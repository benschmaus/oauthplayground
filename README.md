OAuth Playround
===============

The [OAuth Playground](http://googlecodesamples.com/oauth_playground/) for OAuth v1.0a was originally open sourced [here](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-samples/source/browse/#svn/trunk/oauth_playground), but now lives Github.

If you're interested in OAuth 2.0, visit the [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/).
