OAuth Playground (1.0)
===============

The OAuth Playground (for OAuth v1.0a) was originally open sourced at [code.google.com](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-samples/source/browse/#svn/trunk/oauth_playground) in 2009,
and a demo lived at googlecodesamples.com. The source now lives here on Github and the demo domain no longer exists.

If you're interested in OAuth 2.0, visit the [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/).
